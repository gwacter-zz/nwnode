<p class="lead">This project aims to help deploy old computer games Microbee was the first commercially marketed Australian PC manufactured by Applied Technology in June 1982. It ran off the MicroWorld BASIC DGOS (David Griffiths Operating System) operating system and its introductory price was AUD399.00 for the kit. Initially it was released as a kit in 1982 but later sold assembled in Australia and Sweden. It contained either 16 Kilobytes or 32 Kilobytes of memory and had a Zilog Z80 (2 MHz clock speed) CPU. Originally its architecture consisted of a two board unit. One board had the keyboard, Zilog Z80 microprocessor, Synertek 6545 CRT controller, 2 Kilobytes of screen RAM, 2 Kilobytes of character ROM (128 characters) and 2 Kilobytes of Programmable Character Graphics (PCG) RAM (128 characters). A byte within the screen RAM addressed a character in either the character ROM or PCG RAM. The other board (core board) had the memory and eventually had a floppy disk controller (wiki). Effectively it was found to be quite similar to the Radio Shack TRX-80 home computer (which was released in 1977). Comparable to the TRX-80 it had graphic characters, programmable on the same 8 x 16 pixel pattern as screen characters (ASCII). Implementation of programs enabling a user to draw fine lines at any orientation and curve was made possible due to the existence of the graphic characters. The Microbee contained a ROM (which itself had a tiny basic inside it). Microbee however offered the capability for other ROM based components to be included.Initially the Microbee was used in Swedish schools.

<p class="lead">
The Microbee was successful in its initial years, however it was found to be incapable of competing against the present day competitors, one of which was Apple ][ that offered better functionality and range of software. Within a year of the Microbee's first release, the IBM PC (the first Intel based PC) was released. It was also found the manufacturer of Microbee was slow in upgrading the early Microbee to have full graphic capabilities  making the Apple ][ more useful for school use.  Officially it discontinued use in 1990.
So the aim is to make these games available.
